# CBRNeVirtualEnvMultiRobot
An Unreal Engine CBRNe Environment, with the AirSim plugin integrated. As with the AirSim CityEnviron environment, this is a big environment so it's divided into two files. After downloading both 001 and 002 files, please use software such as 7zip to right click on 001 file and chose one of the extract options. 7zip automatically will detect and use both files.
